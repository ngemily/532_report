<!--
What were the strengths and weaknesses of your team? How did you address the
weaknesses? From the perspective of your own experience, what did you need to
learn to do the project. How did you do that learning?

### Team

We have an amazingly capable and diverse team.  Michael has a strong background
in circuits, Patrick and Rob have strong backgrounds in embedded software, and I
have a strong understanding of FPGA design flow.  Naturally, we divided the work
so that Michael would work on the mechatronic component, I would work on the
custom IP block, and Patrick and Rob would cover the block design and software.

### Individual

My greatest failure here was testing the software prototype on clean images
only, and not camera images.
