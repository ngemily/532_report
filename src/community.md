Community Contribution
======================
<!--
Please indicate your community contributions, if any. I will observe who has
been giving help on Piazza but indicate in this section what kinds of help you
provided to make sure I account for it.

Also, if you figured out how to do something that isnâ€™t easy to find or
documented well, or if you just came up with a simple example of how to do
something that you wished you had available at the start, please write it up so
that we can make it available to future users. Include it as a section in your
report, but also send me a zip/tar file of the example and the document as well
so that I can post it.
