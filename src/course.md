Course feedback
===============

<!--
Provide any constructive comments or suggestions you would like to make about the course for the future.
- Did the project timeline work, i.e., demos, deadlines? Could the project be started earlier?
- Does the grading structure work? Suggestions?
- Did you like the “open” lab concept versus strict times and assigned work?
- How could the lecture times be made more useful for you? Were the initial presentations about the tools helpful? Are there other topics that would have helped?
- Please comment on the role of the TAs. How effective are the TAs and is there a way for them to be used better?

Being in Engineering Science, I had the choice between Digital Systems Design,
Energy Systems capstone, and Electrical and Computing capstone to fulfill my
degree requirements.  I chose this course because I wanted to gain more
experience working with FPGAs and from what I knew about the course, I expected
it to be more technical and more structured than the capstone courses.

Now that I've completed the course, I'm really glad I did.  I learned a lot.
From what I gather, the expectations are much higher here (that we have a
certain level of difficulty, certain number of components) and we are expected
to always have something working.  I think these expectations pushed us to
expect more from ourselves and the success of our demo is the most rewarding
thing that came out of it.  My experience here goes beyond getting a grade.
I've taken away skills and confidence.

### Pre-project phase

This part of the course really set the expectation for the amount of work
required weekly.  We especially took it seriously since in total the pre-project
phase was worth 35% of the course.  The tasks were simple, and the focus was
clearly on learning the tools and learning to work as a team.  It was pretty
helpful to have a non-project related warm up.

### Lectures

I attended lecture up until reading week.  The best piece of advice was given
very early: if you want to learn hardware design, find someone to work under.
It was good to become aware of topics that I hadn't heard of before.  Many
topics require a significant theoretical background to really appreciate (e.g.
the background on on-chip-termination is given in a part two electromagnetism
course at UofT), so in some cases I didn't have the mental framework to place
this information.

### Milestone reports

I'm really a fan of the weekly reports and the fact that they're due before the
lab session.  I like the structure, and how it forces you to consider whether or
not you've hit this week's milestone and consider also the aim for the coming
week.  They also gave Charles a chance to look over our progress and challenges
before meeting in the lab which made the lab session more valuable.

My milestone reports are available in Appendix \ref{app:milestones}.

### TAs

It was really great to have very knowledgeable and helpful TAs.  We (my team)
really appreciate the help and advice we got and especially appreciate the extra
office hours and correspondences outside lab hours.  I've heard in the capstone
course that groups have to constantly remind TAs what their project is about.
I'm glad that wasn't the case for us.  Charles kept up with our goals, progress,
and challenges throughout the semester.  In this sort of project, it really
matters that our supervisor cares about project and our success.  It says a lot
students.
