Milestone 1
-----------

I. This week's milestones:

- find image processing algorithm
- evaluate how hardware friendly it is
 
II. Current status

- read some background on image processing, including:
    - image kernel convolution
    - image moments
- explored OpenCV
    - collection of computer vision libraries for C and Python
    - widely used (iOS, Android, OpenCL), comprehensive
    - is compatible with Xilinx HLS
    - documentation includes references to papers for algorithms implemented
- found example for finding contours, tried it on sample image

III. Challenges faced

- don't fully understand algorithms behind library methods
- OpenCV is object oriented; won't be easy to write in pure C
- also won't be easy to design in hardware
 
IV. Next week's milestones

- prototype in software
- reduce OpenCV functions used to simpler computational kernels, boil it down to something simpler
 
V. Project modifications

- none so far
