Reflection
==========

<!--
What were the strengths and weaknesses of your team? How did you address the
weaknesses? From the perspective of your own experience, what did you need to
learn to do the project. How did you do that learning?
-->

### Team

We have an amazingly capable and diverse team.  Michael has a strong background
in circuits, Patrick and Rob have strong backgrounds in embedded software, and I
have a strong understanding of FPGA design flow.  Naturally, we divided the work
so that Michael would work on the mechatronic component, I would work on the
custom IP block, and Patrick and Rob would cover the block design and software.

### Individual

My greatest failure here was testing the software prototype on clean images
only, and not camera images.


Community Contribution
======================
<!--
Please indicate your community contributions, if any. I will observe who has
been giving help on Piazza but indicate in this section what kinds of help you
provided to make sure I account for it.

Also, if you figured out how to do something that isn’t easy to find or
documented well, or if you just came up with a simple example of how to do
something that you wished you had available at the start, please write it up so
that we can make it available to future users. Include it as a section in your
report, but also send me a zip/tar file of the example and the document as well
so that I can post it.

Course feedback
===============

<!--
Provide any constructive comments or suggestions you would like to make about the course for the future.
- Did the project timeline work, i.e., demos, deadlines? Could the project be started earlier?
- Does the grading structure work? Suggestions?
- Did you like the “open” lab concept versus strict times and assigned work?
- How could the lecture times be made more useful for you? Were the initial presentations about the tools helpful? Are there other topics that would have helped?
- Please comment on the role of the TAs. How effective are the TAs and is there a way for them to be used better?
-->

### Pre-project phase

This part of the course really set the expectation for the amount of work
required weekly.  The tasks were simple, and the focus was clearly on learning
the tools.  It was pretty helpful to have a non-project related warm up.

### Lectures

I attended lecture up until reading week.  The best piece of advice was given
very early: if you want to learn hardware design, find someone to work under.
The topics covered didn't have enough context for me to fully appreciate it, but
it's good to have heard of them, for example the discussion on clock domains.

### Milestone reports

I'm really a fan of the due Sunday night reports.  I like the structure, and
how it forces you to consider whether or not you've hit this week's milestone
and consider also the aim for the coming week.  They also gave Charles a chance
to look over what we did before our in lab meetings.  This is the most
interaction I've ever had with a TA and personally I learned a lot from it.

### TAs

It was really great to have very knowledgeable and helpful TAs.  We (my team)
really appreciate the time we got outside lab hour, through email correspondence
and office hours.  It was also great that Charles really kept up with our goals,
progress, and challenges.
