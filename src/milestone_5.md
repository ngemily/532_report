Milestone 5
-----------

I. Summary of milestone

- iron out connected components in software
- implement connected components in hardware
- demo Sobel on hardware

II. Status

- got post-synth, post-impl simulation running, matches rtl sim output
- in software:
	- labeling working except for one edge case
	- haven't set up data table
- in hardware:
	- labeling without merging
	- correctly labels the outline of a square
- my work has not been integrated into team project

III. Challenges faced

- haven't gotten enough integration done to show Sobel in hardware
- Michael integrated IP skeleton into block design, Rob is writing driver software

IV. Next week's milestones

- show Sobel on hardware, with Michael and Rob's help to integrate
- complete connected components and write location of objects to AXI registers

V. Project modifications

- none
