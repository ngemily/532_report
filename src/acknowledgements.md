First off, I'd like to thank my team.  Everyone did a great job and I could not
have asked for better teammates.\\

In this project I used a lot of the skills and knowledge I gained during my PEY
at Altera.  I'd like to thank my team at work for teaching me about FPGA CAD
flow, timing analysis, working with simulation, general debugging and above all
being very patient and willing to explain things to me.\\

I would like to thank Professor Chow for organizing this course in such a way
that it encourages us to explore what's out there, build something that we're
proud of, and learn a lot.  Finally, I would like to thank Charles for his
continual support and advice.
