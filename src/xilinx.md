Feedback to Xilinx
==================
<!--

Vivado
------

Coming from Quartus, Vivado was very easy to use.  I could easily find all the
equivalent buttons in the gui and equivalent tcl script interfaces.  Overall,
the gui is much better looking.  I particularly liked the IP integrator layout
which provided an intuitive way of adding IPs to a block design.

One missing feature that I would have enjoyed is virtual IOs.  I had some
projects instantiate inner cores of our design, which had more ports than
available user pins.  This is a common use case and I found others who expressed
their interest in this feature on Xilinx forums.

SDK
---

The SDK frequently crashes when trying to re-run our program, ofter requiring us
to restart the SDK and/or re-program the board.
